        <div class="intro">
            <p>Picture this: you're reading the classic <i>The Book of the City of Ladies</i>, just vibing, when a thought suddenly strikes you: 
                "All these women are pretty epic. I wonder which of them are the most awesome?"</p>
            
            <p>No? Just us? Well, we definitely have. And we made a list about it!</p>
            
            <p>But first, what kind of women made it into Christine de Pizan's legendary city? 
                Besides being total badasses, they had to be <i>Noble</i>, <i>Loyal</i>, <i>Brave</i>, <i>Intelligent</i>, and <i>Virtuous</i>, just to name a few key traits.</p>
            
            <p>So with that in mind, behold: the most awesome women mentioned in <i>The City of Ladies</i>. 
                (And no, unfortunately, Olivia Rodrigo is <b>not</b> on the list üò¢)</p>

        <div class="entry"> 
            <div class="rank">#5 - Empress Nicaula (Part 1)</div>
            <img src="media/queen.jpg">
            <p>This queen (literally) was one of the first women mentioned in the book. Surely that means something, right? Christine talks about
                her in glowing terms. She '...had a profound knowledge of the Scriptures and sciences.' Apparently, she also 
                "...was so proud that she never condescended to take a husband nor felt the need to have a man by her side." That was pretty rare in that time, 
                especially considering that you often needed a man to survive as a woman for most of history. Pretty awesome in our opinion. 
            </p>

        <div class="entry"> 
            <div class="rank">#4 - Sappho (Part 1)</div>
            <img src="media/sappho.jpg">
            <p>Next on our list is the beloved Sappho. Christine basically calls her a genius: 
                ‚ÄúBut of all the gifts she was blessed with, one surpassed all the others and that was her keen intelligence." 
                Part of the reason Christine is writing this book is because the literature of her day always attacked women‚Äôs intelligence 
                by saying they were not as smart as men. Sappho is a prime example of how this is <b>NOT</b> true. She was fighting stereotypes even
                before it was cool.

        <div class="entry"> 
            <div class="rank">#3 - Queen Esther (Part 2)</div>
            <img src="media/ester.jpg">
            <p>Most of us who read the Bible know who Queen Esther is. If you‚Äôre a heretic and don‚Äôt, then allow us to jog your memory. 
                Imagine this: you're a young Jewish woman in a foreign empire, and one day you find out that your people are about to be wiped out. 
                What do you do? Risk your life to save them, of course! Esther didn‚Äôt sit around waiting for someone else to take charge‚Äîshe marched 
                straight up to the king, uninvited (hello, death sentence), and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not letting this happen on my watch.‚Äù Her bravery?
                 Unmatched. Her wisdom? Off the charts. This woman had the courage to change the fate of a whole nation, and she did it with grace 
                 and style. That is why she gets a spot in the City of Ladies and why she is third on our list. </p>

        <div class="entry"> 
            <div class="rank">#2 - Virgin Mary</div>
            <img src="media/mary.jpg">
            <p>Let's be real: if there was ever an MVP in the world of women, it‚Äôs the Virgin Mary. First off, this woman was chosen by 
                God Himself to carry Jesus‚Äîyou know, no big deal. üôÉ Talk about divine responsibility! Mary wasn't out there looking for 
                fame or glory; she was just quietly saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to the universe (and to God‚Äôs plan, obviously) in the most humble way possible. 
                She didn‚Äôt let a little thing like being an unwed mother in a time when that could seriously ruin your life stop her from being 
                literally the mother of God. Christine de Pizan calls her the ultimate model of faith and strength, a compliment that is not 
                thrown around willy-nilly. She inspires us and millions of others, and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs second on our list.</p>

        <div class="entry"> 
            <div class="rank">#1 - Christine de Pizan </div>
            <img src="media/christine.png">
            <p>Ahh, the author herself: Christine de Pizan. Some might call her the first feminist. She is the first on our list because, without her, this list might not even exist. The Muses appeared to her
                after all. In fact, the Muses tell us why they visited her "...you deserved to receive a visit from us because of your great love for true knowledge, 
                which you pursue through long and constant study.‚Äù If that is not a flex, I don't know what is. She is the mastermind of the work and she is the true embodiment
                of all the themes she tries to teach in her book. She truly is the OG girlboss üí™

            <div class="rank">What change does she seek? </div>
			<p>All joking aside, all of the women mentioned in <i>The City of Ladies</i> are incredible and are examples to us all. What changes does she seek? A more equal and fair society. Abolish misinformation about women. 
                A future generation of women that are strong and independent. If nothing else, inspire all to fight for their rights as individuals. I am sure that, if Christine were still here today, she would be amazed at 
                the impact she had and the vast improvements that have taken place in society since her passing.
